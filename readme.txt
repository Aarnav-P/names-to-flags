# Personal_Flags
The goal of this project is to create a deployment of a python program into a web application.  
The motivation is that I had a fun idea, and it would be nice to learn how to create web apps for future fun ideas.  
The work started around July '25, and I have decided to put it on Git.  
  
Progress:  
\> Basic website has been built   
\> html structure is created, with parent and child templates  
\> styles.css file now exists to provide simple control over appearance  
\> Multiple pages exist, with links and navigation  
  
Next Steps:  
\> Deploy to server  
\> Embed program  
\> Display outputs   
\> Receive user inputs for customisation  
\> Add styling to inputs - sliders and buttons etc.  
\> Add saving functionality, buttons to change image output format  
\> Add basic security to website.
